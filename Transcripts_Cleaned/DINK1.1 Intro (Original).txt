Kodak was once almost synonymous with photography and was a major factor in capturing our collective
history, allowing us to share memories with others. Kodak recognised already in the 1970s that
photography could go digital and created the first handheld digital camera in 1975. However,
they initially dropped the product line out of fear of jeopardising their normal film business
and thus delayed their transition to digital. At the same time, they had an 85% market share in
the camera business in the US, maintaining even a 40% share 20 years later. But in 2012,
they had to file for bankruptcy protection, despite their efforts to shift to digital.
In 2007, Nokia supplied 50% of the mobile phones sold worldwide. It was also the year that Apple
launched the first iPhone, with a different take of what a mobile device could be. Five years later,
Nokia's worldwide market share was almost nonexistent, and the mobile phone business was sold
to Microsoft, who later killed the non-successful product line completely. There are many similar
examples, Blackberry, Xerox, Blockbuster to name a few. So is it so that companies cannot transform
themselves or could old and larger companies also innovate? Luckily, there are also examples of just
that. For instance, IBM or car manufacturers like Ford or General Motors.
Stay with us if you want to learn about the difference between innovation and transformation,
which tools help us transform existing businesses or how to make ideas more sustainable
and not just a passing trend.
