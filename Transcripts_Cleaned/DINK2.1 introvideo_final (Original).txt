Welcome to Digital Innovation and Scalability, the second module of the Digital Innovation Canon, a collection of online teaching materials made for DTU. In this module, we will go in depth with scalability of digital solutions from an engineering point of view. Which questions do we as engineers need to ask ourselves? Not just when we are designing solutions meant for rapid scaling, but also when we're designing solutions not meant for large scale. Is there in fact both risks and opportunities to our product or our business hidden in both approaches? We will dive into subjects such as virtual versus physical resources, value creation through users, product versus service, scalability, cloud solutions, advantages and disadvantages, green computing, complexity and security, attack surface, and user management. To present the latest research within these topics, we introduce a series of researchers appearing in videos on the podcast in the next four chapters. And for a real world perspective, we introduce video interviews with three highly successful Danish companies, all based solely on digital innovation, MobilePay, VU, and Corti.
